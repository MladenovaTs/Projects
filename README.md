# Data Science Repository

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains multiple projects. Each project has its own README.md file for detailed information.

## Projects

- [Project 1](Project_1/README.md): This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of an automobile dataset and the development of predictive models for pricing. It encompasses various stages of the data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building and deployment. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from the data and create accurate price prediction models.

- [Project 2](Project_2/README.md): Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) - here it is presented a comprehensive bioinformatic framework for characterizing engineered thymic tissue. Due to confidentiality agreement with Harvard Univesrity, the scope of the presented analysis is limited.

Please refer to the individual project README files for more information about each project.
